#  values from the canonical Node contract and fails the deploy on any drift.

# The game UUID. Must match public/wink-runtime-config.json and the catalog row
# id of the environment below — the two environments have different ids. On dev
# it is the UUID the developer generated before building; on prod it is the one
# the CMS generated when the row was created, so that row has to exist first.
